## EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS ON TRAFFIC VIOLATION DATA FROM PUBLIC SURVEY

I conducted a public survey via google forms and collected real-time data with the aim of doing exploratory data analysis on it.

The answers to the following questions were collected.

I used Jupyter Notebook to start with the project and later shifted to google collab notebook.

The Python libraries used in this project are:
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

I used pandas to import the CSV file into the notebook and conduct an initial analysis of how the data looks and whether it needs to be cleaned or not.
Then again used pandas to clean the data and make it ready for exploration.

Duplicates, empty records were checked, outliers were sorted out and a few data conversions were made to gain insights.

I tried to use the commonly used and important pandas functions in the project.

I used matplotlib to visualize the data to gain insights.
A few of the Screenshots are below:

One of the main insights was that most traffic violations and accidents occur at night. This insight leads to one of my other projects, ‘Automatic Number Plate Recognition’.

Learnings from this project:
- I learned to collect real-time data from the public.
- I learned how to work with pandas and how to use them to manipulate/clean the data.
- How to manage outliers in the dataset.
- How to create meaningful visualizations with matplotlib.
